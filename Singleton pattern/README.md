# Singleton Pattern
Ensure that a class has one instance and provide a global point of access to it ,we can say that this pattern is our ticket to creating one-of-a-kind objects for which there is only one instance.

### Problem
We have a chocolate boiler that mix up the milk and chocolate and keep boiler boiling and filling 

### In the future (we want)
- at anytime we want to check for boiling and filled instance.

### Now pattern talks
